    "##  Write a program that takes a string as input, and counts the frequency of each word in the string, there might be repeated characters in the string. Your task is to find the highest frequency and returns the length of the highest-frequency word. Note - You have to write at least 2 additional test cases in which your program will run successfully and provide an explanation for the same.
